Author: Gabriel Rodríguez Fernández
Released: May 15, 2015
Previous version: 2.0


//------------------MAIN CHANGES-----------------\\

- Minor code optimization.

- Additional languages are now supported:
        + French
        + Italian

- Minor fixes.

- Fixed error that caused the application to crash
when the lang file was missing, empty or corrupted.
Now, the game will start in English by default when
this problem occurs, and the lang file will be fixed.
The game will start normally the next time.

- Fixed error that caused the application to crash
when a LangResources file was missing. The game
will now automatically start in English if this
happens, and the user will be advised to redownload
the game files.

- Fixed error that allowed the player to attack again
when a finished game was reloaded.

- Fixed error that caused no "load game" screen to
be created when the "saves" folder didn't exist.


//-----------------USER SUPPORT-----------------\\

- How can I translate the game into a new language?

     To do so, translate a "LangResources" file and put
   the translated file into the "rsrc" folder. The game
   will automatically detect new languages.
     The translated file must be named following the
   format established below:
	
               LangResources_xx.properties
			
   where "xx" is the two letter code of the language.
     If the game is able to detect a valid language,
   according to the ISO 639 standard, the proper name
   of said language will be displayed in the "Language"
   menu of the game. If the language is not detected
   as a valid one, the initials specified in the file
   will be displayed instead. However, non-valid
   languages will work anyway.


//-----------------PROJECT USAGE----------------\\
