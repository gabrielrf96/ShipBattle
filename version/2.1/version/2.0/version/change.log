//------------------SHIP BATTLE------------------\\
//------------------VERSION 2.0------------------\\

Author: Gabriel Rodríguez Fernández
Released: April 5, 2015
Previous version: 1.0


//------------------MAIN CHANGES-----------------\\

- Major optimization

- Added changelog

- Added language support:
        + Spanish
        + English

- Automatic language detection: makes it easier for
users to translate the program into any language.

- Added save/load game options

- Fixed multiple runtime errors

- Fixed error that caused a new game to be initiated 
even though the player hit the "cancel" button on 
the name input window.

- Fixed error that broke the game when language was
changed during a match.

- Fixed error: if the player places four ships, 
and tries to put another one in an occupied cell, 
the game will start with the player having only 
four ships.


//-------------GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS------------\\

- Enemy sectors already attacked by the player are
now displayed in a different color to avoid repeats.

- The machine will not repeat an already attacked
player's sector, thus making the machine a little
bit less silly.

- Action is now centered in the game window. This
means that information dialogs and secondary screens
(Changelog and Load Screen) will appear in the center
of the main game window, instead of in the center of
the screen.


//----------------KNOWN PROBLEMS----------------\\

- The game will crash if the "lang" file is missing,
empty or corrupted.


------------------------------------------------------------------
 These problems are still being worked on, and 
                          will soon be solved.             
------------------------------------------------------------------


//-----------------USER SUPPORT-----------------\\

- How can I translate the game into a new language?

     To do so, translate a "LangResources" file and put
   the translated file into the "rsrc" folder. The game
   will automatically detect new languages.
     The translated file must be named following the
   format established below:
	
               LangResources_xx.properties
			
   where "xx" is the two letter code of the language.
     If the game is able to detect a valid language,
   according to the ISO 639 standard, the proper name
   of said language will be displayed in the "Language"
   menu of the game. If the language is not detected
   as a valid one, the initials specified in the file
   will be displayed instead. However, non-valid
   languages will work anyway.


//-----------------PROJECT USAGE----------------\\

You may freely use and share all the code within
this project, for both commercial and non-commercial
purposes.

You may not, however:

- Entirely redistribute the game for commercial
purposes.

- Sell the game to others. The game is free and is
just a practice project.

- Share the entire game as if it were yours, unless
you add major changes or take just pieces of code.
