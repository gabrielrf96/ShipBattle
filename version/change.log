//------------------SHIP BATTLE------------------\\
//------------------VERSION 2.2------------------\\

Author: Gabriel Rodríguez Fernández
Released: Jul 23, 2015
Previous version: 2.1


//------------------MAIN CHANGES-----------------\\

- Major code optimization and reorganization.

- Fixed minor errors that caused the game not to be
able to locate resource files on GNU/Linux systems.

- Fixed compatibility issues with GNU/Linux and Mac 
OS systems.

- Fix: player name now updates when a game is loaded.

- Complete GUI redesign.

- Game related messages now appear in a non-invasive
way (message box), thus not bothering the player.


//--------------GAME IMPROVEMENTS---------------\\

- New game mechanics: one ship (two blocks) and three
boats (one block) must be placed. When a position is
attacked, the message displayed will tell you if you
have sunk or touched a ship, or touched water.

- Game difficulty levels added. Machine AI improves
with each level of difficulty.

//-----------------USER SUPPORT-----------------\\

- How can I translate the game into a new language?

     To do so, translate a "LangResources" file and put
   the translated file into the "rsrc" folder. The game
   will automatically detect new languages.
     The translated file must be named following the
   format established below:
	
               LangResources_xx.properties
			
   where "xx" is the two letter code of the language.
     If the game is able to detect a valid language,
   according to the ISO 639 standard, the proper name
   of said language will be displayed in the "Language"
   menu of the game. If the language is not detected
   as a valid one, the initials specified in the file
   will be displayed instead. However, non-valid
   languages will work anyway.


//-----------------PROJECT USAGE----------------\\

You may freely use and share all the code within
this project, for both commercial and non-commercial
purposes.

You may not, however:

- Entirely redistribute the game for commercial
purposes.

- Sell the game to others. The game is free and is
just a practice project.

- Share the entire game as if it were yours, unless
you add major changes or take just pieces of code.
